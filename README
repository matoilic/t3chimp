MailChimp extension for Typo3. See the wiki for documentation: https://github.com/matoilic/t3chimp/wiki

Currently the extension only supports only the inclusion of subscription forms in the frontend. If you have any 
wishes for further integration e.g. with other extensions or if you find any bugs just create a ticket.

If you have any other questions or need support feel free to contact me through the form on my homepage http://matoilic.ch
